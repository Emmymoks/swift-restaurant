# Swift Restaurant — Frontend

A modern React + Vite + Tailwind website for **Swift Restaurant** ("The true taste of Nigeria, on your plate").

## Features
- React + Vite starter
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Responsive layout with hero, menu grid, detailed dish cards, contact form and footer
- Uses Unsplash "source" images for functional stock photos of Nigerian food

## Quick start
1. Unzip the archive.
2. In the project folder, run:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` to view locally.

## Deploying to Vercel
- This is a standard Vite app. Push to GitHub and import the repo in Vercel (default settings).
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

## Notes
- Images are loaded from `source.unsplash.com` queries so they'll display as functional stock images. Replace with self-hosted images if desired.
- Prices in the menu are illustrative (Naira).

Enjoy — and feel free to ask for enhancements (cart, CMS, full checkout, multilingual support).
